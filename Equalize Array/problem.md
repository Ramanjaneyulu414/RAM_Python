# Equalize the Array with Limited Moves

You are given an integer array A of length N.
In one operation, you may choose a contiguous subarray [L, R] and either
increase or decrease all elements in that subarray by 1.

Find the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements equal.

## Input
N
A1 A2 A3 ... AN

## Output
Minimum number of operations.

## Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 2×10⁵
-10⁹ ≤ Ai ≤ 10⁹
